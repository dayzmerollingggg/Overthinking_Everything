                <h3>Line Holder</h3>
                <p class="pb-2"><em><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);">September 2023</span></em></p>
                
                <p>Typical events at a college all end up in the same way: there is a long line that doesn&rsquo;t seem to move at all and in the end most people get turned away. This is not ideal for the ones who actually do want to enter the event or get free food, but it&rsquo;s perfect for you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>As a line holder, your job will be to stand in these long lines and &ldquo;hold a spot&rdquo; for others. Have a sign up (either strung around your neck or as a poster as shown in <em>fig. 1</em>) that reads &ldquo;cut into my spot for $xxx&rdquo;. Put whatever price best suits the average price a college student of your college would be willing to spend on a small luxury item. Imagine the amount of money an individual person would spend for an expensive dinner meal. At the bottom of the sign you could have payment options. Recommendations include cash, Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle (example given in <em>fig. 2</em>).&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Every time someone pays for your spot in line, quickly rush to the back of the line and start the process over again (<em>fig. 3</em>). This is the more ethical way. If you are not ethical, let the person in front of you but don&rsquo;t move. This way is not recommended since you might be thrown out before making a lot of money (<em>fig. 3</em>).&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This method also allows for team effort. Gather some friends and crash the line (<em>fig. 4</em>)</p>

                <h3>Furniture Upseller</h3>
                <p class="pb-2"><em><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);">November 2023</span></em></p>
                <p>As college students move out away from home, one market demand rises: cheap furniture. Whether it&rsquo;s in the university dorms or a nearby apartment building, furniture is needed to make people&rsquo;s daily lives comfortable and more productive. But, as fore-mentioned in the section title, most college students do not have the luxury to afford retail priced furniture. So, what&rsquo;s the next best option?</p>
                <p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
                <p>Upselling used furniture is a great way to make a small business. If you have a close friend who understands DIY furniture or furniture in general, it will be a good idea to make a business with them, since you can skip some of the research listed below.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You will need to do some location research beforehand in order to maximize profits, though. First, you will need to find a place to obtain the furniture no one wants (preferably for free, but other options are available as well). One way is to find a financially well-off neighborhood that has a service for bulk item trash day. The day before the local services clear up the bulk items, you can drive around and look for thrown out furniture. Another option is to find the dump place people take their old furniture. This knowledge can be obtained either by asking around or searching up online. One other option is to post flyers about taking in unwanted furniture from people, emphasizing your concerns about the planet and how you will make sure to give the furniture a second home and reduce the amount of waste. One final option for free furniture obtainment is to go on popular market websites such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or any local selling site and try to find free listings. More about none free options below.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Now that you have the places to obtain furniture, there&rsquo;s a few more pieces of knowledge you will need to know in order to get your furniture to actually be sold. Using the same popular market websites above, including Amazon and Etsy, research some best selling furniture listings. Take note of the style, color, quality, build, and whatever other trends you notice. These are the types of furniture you want to look out for when &nbsp;furniture scavenging. This is also what you want to look for when buying used furniture, more on that below.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For none free furniture options, all of the market places mentioned work, as well as local thrift stores or donation centers. Since you are paying for these items, make sure to haggle for the price so that it fits the quality of the item. Only buy items that won&rsquo;t fall apart on you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For most of the options, having a pickup truck or trailer is a necessity for moving all the heavy stuff. If you already have a truck or a car with the capabilities to haul furniture, congrats! Otherwise, there are many ways to get the keys to a truck. One option is to borrow a friend&rsquo;s truck and buy them a meal in return. If those close to you don&rsquo;t have a truck, another way is to ask for a day&rsquo;s borrowing of a truck in a neighborhood post, physically on a flyer or online on a forum. You can put out a price to borrow the truck and negotiate. Another is to go through an actual truck renting company.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once you obtain a moving vehicle, do some test runs with driving. You don&rsquo;t want to crash the vehicle, especially one that&rsquo;s rented. The furniture inside the truck might also not have a good chance of being sold anymore. Once you&rsquo;re confident, combine your location research with your knowledge of sellable furniture and happy hunting and gathering.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once you have the furniture, you can list your findings to a college app (such as one where students can post questions or comments) or create a website using a free website builder (no code necessary such as Wix or Weebly or Google Sites) and post pictures of the furniture and price. Have students contact you at an email or phone number for inquiries. List reasonable prices for the price you paid to obtain the furniture. Anything to high will scare off students. Start with some small groups and build your reputation and establish a monopoly. You can also employ friends to find new items or keep the inventory updated.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Quick notes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salary depends on activity and type of furniture sold. To optimize profits, gather a large amount of furniture every time you go out. </li>
                    <li>Supplies needed: vehicle to move furniture (or strong movers), knowledge of sellable furniture (or someone who can guide you), website to host the listings, effort to market the business, DIY supplies (optional)</li>
